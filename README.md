# Dev-Environment-with-Terraform-and-AWS

This project introduces beginners to building a dev environment with **Terraform** and **AWS**.

## Prerequisites

1. AWS account.
2. Creation of **AWS IAM keys**
3. Terraform installation.
4. Microsoft Visual Studio Code **(VSC)** Installation or an IDE of choice.
   **NB**
   Installation of VSC is most prefered.
5. Installation of the following VSC extensions
   - AWS Toolkit
   - Remote - SSH

Next, we proceed to create resources in our AWS instance, by automating the process right from our terraform files. 9 resources were created in our AWS instance right from terraform. These resources are:

1. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
2. Subnet into the VPC.
3. Internet Gateway.
4. Route Table.
5. Route.
6. Route Table Association.
7. Security Group
8. Key Pair
9. Ubuntu Server (Here, ubuntu 20.0.4 was chosen).
   Under resource 9:
   - we increased the disk space from the default 8Gb to 10Gb; under the ***root_block_device***.
   - We also specified a provisioner and an interpreter which informs the system which scripting tool to use based on the host operating system.

## How to use this repo

Run git clone [https://github.com/Behordeun/Dev-Environment-with-Terraform-and-AWS.git](https://github.com/Behordeun/Dev-Environment-with-Terraform-and-AWS.git)

After having cloned the repository, run `terraform init` to initialize your terraform work environment.

After setting up your workflow, run:

```
# initialize terraform

terraform init
```

```
# Check the resources that will be added to your AWS EC2 instance

terraform plan
```

```
# Apply (create) the resources

terraform apply
```

If you run **terraform apply**, you will get a prompt to type **yes**. If you do not want to get any prompt, run

```
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## Tips

Here are a few terraform commands and their functions.

- `terraform init -upgrade` - Reinitialize terraform to catch up with updates in your files.
- `terraform state list` - Lists all the resources in your instance.
- `terraform state show <resource name>` - Displays all properties of the specified resource.
- `terraform destroy` - Destroys and delete all the resources in your instance.
- `terraform apply -replace <resource name>` - run the creation of resources again, while making a change to the specified resource.
- `terraform apply -refresh` - Updates the resources without having to destroy the resources.
- `terraform console` - An interpreter that you can use to evaluate Terraform expressions and explore your Terraform project's state.

These and more are Terraform commands.
