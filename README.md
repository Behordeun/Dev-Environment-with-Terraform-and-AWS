# Dev-Environment-with-Terraform-and-AWS

This project introduces beginners to building a dev environment with **Terraform** and **AWS**.

## Prerequisites

1. AWS account.
2. Creation of **AWS IAM keys**
3. Terraform installation.
4. Microsoft Visual Studio Code **(VSC)** Installation or an IDE of choice.
   **NB**
   Installation of VSC is most prefered.
5. Installation of the following VSC extensions
   - AWS Toolkit
   - Remote - SSH

### How to use this repo

Run git clone [https://github.com/Behordeun/Dev-Environment-with-Terraform-and-AWS.git](https://github.com/Behordeun/Dev-Environment-with-Terraform-and-AWS.git)

After having cloned the repository, run `terraform init` to initialize your terraform work environment.

After setting up your workflow, run:

```
# initialize terraform

terraform init
```

```
# Check the resources that will be added to your AWS EC2 instance

terraform plan
```

```
# Apply (create) the resources

terraform apply
```

If you run **terraform apply**, you will get a prompt to type **yes**. If you do not want to get any prompt, run

```
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

### Tips

Here are a few terraform commands and their functions.

* `terraform init -upgrade` - Reinitialize terraform to catch up with updates in your files.
* `terraform state list` - Lists all the resources in your instance.
* `terraform state show <resource name>` - Displays all properties of the specified resource.
* `terraform destroy` - Destroys and delete all the resources in your instance.
* `terraform apply -replace <resource name>` - run the creation of resources again, while making a change to the specified resource.
* `terraform apply -refresh` - Updates the resources without having to destroy the resources.
* `terraform console` - An interpreter that you can use to evaluate Terraform expressions and explore your Terraform project's state.

These and more are Terraform commands.
